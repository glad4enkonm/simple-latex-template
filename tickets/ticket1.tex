\ticket{What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?}

\subsection*{Answer}

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two main categories of machine learning algorithms.

\subsubsection*{Supervised Learning}
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. This means that each data point is tagged with a correct output or label. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen data.

Example: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location. The model is trained on a dataset of houses with known prices.

\subsubsection*{Unsupervised Learning}
The algorithm learns from an unlabeled dataset. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without any predefined labels.

Example: Clustering customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior. The algorithm identifies the clusters without any prior knowledge of customer groups.
